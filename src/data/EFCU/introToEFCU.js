    body: "Everest FCU is the first credit union serving the Nepalese American community. When I joined, the institution faced low digital adoption, operational inefficiencies, and limited brand trust. Over 80% of applications were completed in person. Internal workflows were fragmented. Growth was constrained. I led a full digital and operational transformation to support scale, establishing a new brand identity and scalable design system while rebuilding the website, applications, and internal workflows."
